# Getting Started with Simple Weather App by Chin-Hsiang Ho

Simple web application that will show the current temperature (celsius) as well as the min/max temperature (celsius) and precipitation (mm) for the next 5 days.

Press Use Current Location to view the weather and forecast for the current location.
If geolocation access is denied or not available for your browser, the corresponding error message will display in the center.

Enter any city name worldwide and press enter to view matching cities in the drop down menu.
If no city exists, it will display 'City not found' in red in the center.

Select a city from the drop down menu to view the weather and forecast for that location.

In the project directory, run:
